# Tech Stack:

**Front-end**: HTML, CSS, (or you can use JS) <br>
**Back-end**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login <br>
**Database**: SQLite <br>
**Deployment**: Web server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI), Deployment server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) <br>

## Requirements:
**User Authentication**: User login, registration, and session management <br>
**Content Management**: Uploading, editing, deleting, and retrieving content (videos, reels, Articles, threads, blogs) <br>
**Recommendation System**: Suggesting content based on user interests <br>
**User Profile Management**: Storing and managing user information (username, password, name, profile photo, interests) <br>
**Content Routing**: Handling user requests for specific content types

## **IMPORTANT NOTE**
Before running the application, make sure to create a test & admin account from the `/signup` endpoint.
- I added a GET request-based authentication condition on every `/admin` route which **is NOT secure enough** because anyone can easily perform the POST request. I made this app in 2-3 days so I didn't implement any strong restrictions but you can ..!! (BTW if you can implement RESTful APIs in this project feel free to create a PR)

### Admin Portal
```
@app.route('/admin', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def internal():
    if request.method == 'GET': 
        if current_user.username != 'admin':
            return redirect(url_for('login'))

    users = User.query.all()
    return render_template('users.html', users=users)
 
```

- Or you can change the username in the code as per your suitability.

## Please Read This.
- I developed this app myself in a very short time frame(2-3 days). If you're interested in RESTful APIs or just want to develop this project in any manner feel free to collaborate, just create a PR for your idea/implementation, and I would love to add you as a contributor.
